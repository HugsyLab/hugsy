description: Create git commit
---

Create a well-structured git commit:

1. Review changes: `git status` and `git diff`
2. Determine commit type: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore
3. Stage files: `git add`
4. Create commit with conventional format:
   - type(scope): description
5. Include issue references if applicable
